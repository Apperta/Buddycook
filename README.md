# BuddyCook
### A free and open-source web-based cooking application for people with learning disabilities

## About

BuddyCook project aims to develop a cooking pan temperature feedback system for those with learning disabilities, in order to assist in the understanding of cooking, timing and temperature of pans. To improve the user interaction and areas where the cooking process can be made more user friendly for those with special educational needs. 

## Guide to BuddyCook

BuddyCook is a web-based application which provides interactive cooking instructions for SEN (special educational needs) users, who are assumed to be able-bodied. An inbuilt temperature sensor within the cooking pan and an encoded timer allows instructions to be given based on the temperature of the food, and duration of cooking.

The user navigates through the recipe using large forward and back arrow buttons. One step of the recipe would be shown on each page, accompanied by an image, and the current temperature of the pan. Each page displays the timer and temperature readings of each stage.
